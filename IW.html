    <h1>Internet Search Techniques</h1>
    <h3>The Visible Web?</h3>
    <p>“Surface web” – indexed by general purpose search engines URL-available, interlinked content, data in the Knowledge Graph, databases linked from search engines</p>
    <h3>The Invisible Web</h3>
    <p>The deep web, invisible web, or hidden web are parts of the World Wide Web whose contents are not indexed by standard web search-engine programs. This is in contrast to the "surface web", which is accessible to anyone using the Internet. Computer-scientist Michael K. Bergman is credited with inventing the term in 2001 as a search-indexing term.</p>
    <p>Deep web sites can be accessed by a direct URL or IP address, but may require entering a password or other security information to access actual content. Such sites have uses such as web mail, online banking, cloud storage, restricted-access social-media pages and profiles, some web forums and code language that require registration for viewing content. It also includes paywalled services such as video on demand and some online magazines and newspapers.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_web">[Wikipedia]</a></p>
    <br>
    <p>The first conflation of the terms "deep web" with "dark web" happened during 2009 when deep web search terminology was discussed together with illegal activities occurring on the Freenet and darknet. Those criminal activities include the commerce of personal passwords, false identity documents, drugs, firearms, and child pornography.</p>
    <p>Since then, after their use in the media's reporting on the black-market website Silk Road, media outlets have generally used 'deep web' synonymously with the dark web or darknet, a comparison some reject as inaccurate and consequently has become an ongoing source of confusion. Wired reporters Kim Zetter and Andy Greenberg recommend the terms be used in distinct fashions. While the deep web is a reference to any site that cannot be accessed by a traditional search engine, the dark web is a portion of the deep web that has been hidden intentionally and is inaccessible by standard browsers and methods.</p>
    <h3>Why Invisible?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="/SE.html">Search engines, any bots</a> not welcome
            <ul>
                <li>Robots exclusion protocol</li>
                <li>CAPTCHA-protected pages</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Content requires subscription</li>
        <li>Personalized content
            <ul>
                <li>Social media, a user profile on a company website, Internet bank
                    <ul>
                        <li>Requires authentication (a kind of subscription)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Page has no URL, almost</li>
        <li>Contextual content
            <ul>
                <li>Specific to the sequence of browsed pages; the sequence depends on user input</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Duplicate content</li>
        <li>Depth of crawl
            <ul>
                <li>There are too many pages on the website.</li>
                <li>Those buried too deeply may be left not crawled.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Document is not linked from already crawled documents. Therefore, it is never crawled</li>
        <li>Document is too large, more than 15 MB</li>
        <li>File format not accepted</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>The Dark Web</h3>
    <p>The dark web is the World Wide Web content that exists on darknets: overlay networks that use the Internet but require specific software, configurations, or authorization to access. Through the dark web, private computer networks can communicate and conduct business anonymously without divulging identifying information, such as a user's location. The dark web forms a small part of the deep web, the part of the Web not indexed by web search engines, although sometimes the term deep web is mistakenly used to refer specifically to the dark web.</p>
